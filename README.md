# rfbunch
Polynomial strategy bunching estimation with multiple response variables in Stata. Implements various polynomial bunching estimators from Saez (2010), Chetty et. al (2011), Kleven and Waseem (2013), Diamond and Persson (2016) and Andresen and Thorvaldsen (2024). In development, bugs are likely. Report through GitHub or martin.eckhoff.andresen@gmail.com

Note: For estimation of labor supply elasticities, this package has been superceded by polbunch, see https://github.com/martin-andresen/polbunch.
